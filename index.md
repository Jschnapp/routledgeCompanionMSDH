## Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities 

Proposed as part of the [Routledge Companions Series](http://www.routledge.com/books/series/ROUTCOMPS/), the *Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities* shares ways to argue about mediation through new media. Containing fifty+ chapters, it highlights how media studies and digital humanities happen beyond text: about, with, and through new media such as audio, film, television, videogames, databases, algorithms, and electronics. Anchored in arts and humanities perspectives, it also underscores the social, cultural, political, aesthetic, and embodied dimensions of new media production.  

## Audience 

The *Companion*'s intended audience includes advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students curious about conducting applied media studies, blending cultural criticism with computation, authoring multimodal scholarly communications, and enacting social justice work through new media. It assumes the intersections of media studies and digital humanities are usually opaque to most audiences, especially people who are new to either field. As such, the *Companion*'s emphasis is communicating key and compelling methodologies to students in the arts and humanities. 

## Composition 

The *Companion* does not assume the form of a textbook, encyclopedia, or keywords collection. As a guide, it instead gives its contributors opportunities to convey the relevance of their methodologies and media practices to an array of audiences. It also surveys important differences across the contributors' approaches, projects, settings, styles, and perspectives, without assuming a unified voice across the chapters. These chapters contain original material and are relatively brief (~5000 words each). 

## Staus

The *Companion* is currently under contract with Routledge. The contributors and editor are aiming for publication in 2017.
