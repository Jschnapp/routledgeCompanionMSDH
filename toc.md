# Introduction 

By Jentery Sayers 

## 1. Access, Praxis, Justice

Chapter 1. "Theory/Practice: Lessons Learned from Feminist Film Studies," by Tara McPherson 

> Abstract forthcoming
  
Chapter 2. "#cut/paste+bleed: Entangling Feminist Affect, Action, and Production On and Offline," by Alexandra Juhasz 

> This chapter considers one of the author’s media-critical and -situated projects, ev-ent-anglement, as a lab where doing and thinking in community and within the sites or technologies under consideration are the scholarship. In such scholarly work, the doing and the process are the product, and what is built towards those ends can also be shared and/or evaluated in other contexts and for different communities. This allocating and re-allocating of process in and as the product is modeled in the essay itself, albeit within yet another technology: the paper-bound scholarly anthology. The chapter places ev-ent-anglement into the author's larger scholarly project that engages, critically, with social media networks from inside them; shares lessons learned about practice-based research; and concludes with why such methods (as much as findings) might matter. She explains her thinking and doing, and the histories and theories that motivated this critical internet experiment where "our object was our self and ourselves and then these objects got out of hand."

Chapter 3. "Analog Girls in Digital Worlds: Dismantling Binaries for Digital Humanists Who Research Social Media," by Moya Bailey and Reina Gossett

> Not only academics have the skills and means to integrate digital tools and humanistic inquiry. We argue that these distinctions are both real and imagined and as such need to be examined closely to determine the intricate and multilayered dynamics of each space. We make two main arguments in this chapter: the digital world and the ivory tower are powerful tools for circulating ideas and creating access to our communities, and the power that the digital and academic worlds wield needs to be challenged, both from the inside and out.

Chapter 4. "(Cyber)Ethnographies of Contact, Dialogue, Friction: Connecting, Building, Placing, and Doing 'Data,'" by Radhika Gajjala, Erika M Behrmann, and Jeanette Dillon

> Abstract forthcoming

Chapter 5. "Of, By, and For the Internet: New Media Studies and Public Scholarship," by Aimée Morrison 

> This chapter proposes we must actively work to craft a new media studies of, by, and for the internet, one that must seek to transform rather than simply disrupt both scholarship and the broader social landscape, or our online scholarly practices will certainly reinscribe existing hierarchies and inequities. New media studies, of, by, and for the internet is not the abstract and utopian dream for perfect communication envisioned in the early 1990s, suited to more idealistic aims of seamless transmission of information. It is about whose speech is suppressed, by what means, and how this suppression can be countered. It is about the care work entailed in seeking social change, accounting for the toll this care work exacts, and sharing that load more equitably by extending material and emotional supports to those from whom this work demands the highest personal costs. I consider viral academic speech as offering the opportunity to develop and sustain new modes of "public/scholarship," beginning by examining a viral academic speech event that happened to me.
